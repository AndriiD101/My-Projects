1. Dataset Selection
✅ Dataset: UCI Bank Marketing Dataset
This is a complex, real-world dataset ideal for binary classification (yes/no) — perfect for testing different network configurations.

2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Includes:
- Basic statistics: distributions, missing values
- Visualizations: bar plots, histograms, pair plots, correlation matrix

3. Test 5 Different Network Topologies
You will:
- Define 5 feedforward neural networks (NNs) with different:
  - Number of hidden layers
  - Number of neurons per layer
- Keep everything else (batch size, optimizer, learning rate, epochs) constant
- Save training/validation accuracy and loss

4. Optimizer Comparison
On the best topology from step 3, you will:
- Compare at least 3 optimizers:
  - SGD
  - Adam
  - RMSprop (and optionally Adagrad or AdamW)
- Evaluate impact on performance

5. Learning Rate Testing
- Using best model + best optimizer
- Test at least 5 values: e.g. 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1
- Plot learning rate vs. accuracy or loss

6. Activation Functions
- Try at least 5:
  - ReLU
  - Sigmoid
  - Tanh
  - LeakyReLU
  - ELU or Swish
- Explain any lesser-known ones in the report

7. Final Model
- Save the best model using torch.save()
- Include random.seed() for reproducibility

8. Report
Use the IEEE one-column template.
- Include all results, confusion matrix for the best model
- Visualizations from matplotlib
- Discussion about why some configurations work better
