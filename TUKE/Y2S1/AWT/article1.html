    <div class="default_text">
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live, work, and interact with technology. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to complex systems that diagnose diseases or power self-driving cars, AI is reshaping industries and opening up new possibilities for innovation. But what exactly is AI, and how does it work? In this article, we’ll break down the basics of AI, how it functions, and why it's so impactful.
    </div>

    <div class="default_text">
        <p>There is a statement which says: <i class="quote"> "People who are able to keep up with AI development are more likely to go further than people who don’t know how to use it right."</i></p>

    <h2>What is AI?</h2>

    <div class="default_text">
        <p>AI is a field of computer science that focuses on enabling machines to learn, adapt, and make decisions. It involves using algorithms and techniques to analyze data, simulate human intelligence, and create intelligent systems. AI can be used to improve various aspects of human life, such as healthcare, transportation, and education.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Types of AI</h2>

    <div class="default_text">
        <p>AI can be categorized into two main types:</p>
    </div>

    <ul style="font-size: 20px">
        <li><b>Narrow AI (Weak AI):</b> This is the most common form of AI we see today, designed to perform a specific task (e.g., facial recognition, voice assistants). It excels in one particular area but lacks general intelligence.</li>
        <li><b>General AI (Strong AI):</b> This type of AI, still largely theoretical, would possess human-like cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks. It would understand and reason about the world, much like a human does.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Does AI Work?</h2>
    <h3>AI systems are built on a combination of algorithms, data, and computing power. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and processes that allow AI to function:</h3>

    <ol style="font-size: 20px">
        <li>
            <div style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">Machine Learning (ML)</div>
            <div class="default_text">Machine Learning is the engine behind most AI systems. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, AI uses machine learning algorithms to learn from data. ML models identify patterns in large datasets and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions.</div>
            <div class="default_text">For example, an AI system designed to recognize images of cats will be trained on thousands of labeled images. The more data it has, the better it becomes at distinguishing cats from other objects.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">Deep Learning (DL)</div>
            <div class="default_text">A subset of machine learning, deep learning takes inspiration from the human brain. It uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence the term "deep") to analyze complex data. Deep learning is particularly powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.</div>
            <div class="default_text">Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes (similar to neurons in the brain) that process input data and adjust based on the output accuracy. This enables the system to improve its performance over time.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</div>
            <div class="default_text">One of AI’s most impressive abilities is understanding and generating human language. Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to interpret, process, and respond to language in a way that feels natural. This is the technology behind chatbots, translation tools, and voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">Computer Vision</div>
            <div class="default_text">Another significant area of AI is computer vision, which allows machines to understand and interpret visual information from the world. Using image recognition and object detection techniques, AI can identify faces, objects, and even emotions in photos and videos. This technology is vital for applications like self-driving cars, facial recognition, and medical imaging.</div>
        </li>
    </ol>
